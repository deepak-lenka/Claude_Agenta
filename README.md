Project Title: Claude _Agenta

Description:
Agenta is an open-source platform designed to streamline the experimentation, evaluation, and deployment of large language models (LLMs). It empowers developers to fine-tune prompts iteratively, optimizing their effectiveness in generating high-quality text outputs. By facilitating prompt testing and ranking mechanisms, Agenta enhances the integration of LLMs into various applications, fostering advancements in natural language processing.

Key Features:
1. Prompt Iteration: Easily define parameters and prompts for iterative testing, allowing developers to refine prompt effectiveness.
2. Evaluation Framework: Utilize built-in ranking mechanisms to assess prompt performance and optimize text generation.
3. Flexible Deployment: Seamlessly integrate with existing workflows, enabling deployment of refined prompts for diverse applications.
4. Open-Source Community: Benefit from collaborative development and contribute to the advancement of natural language processing technologies.

Installation:
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Configure API keys for Anthropic and any other required services.
3. Run the application locally or deploy it to your preferred hosting environment.

Usage:
1. Define the project parameters and input variables.
2. Generate candidate prompts based on the provided description and test cases.
3. Test and evaluate the prompts using built-in mechanisms, refining them for optimal performance.
4. Deploy the optimized prompts alongside your preferred large language model for text generation tasks.
